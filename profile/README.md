# Aberration Labs, Inc.

Aberration Labs, Inc. is a software development company that specializes in creating web, iOS, and Android applications. Our primary focus is on developing white-label and boutique apps for small and medium-sized businesses, providing them access to high-quality software solutions without the prohibitive costs of hiring and maintaining an in-house development team.

## Our Mission

We aim to bridge the gap between small businesses and high-end software, offering solutions that would typically be out of reach due to cost. By providing self-manageable apps and platforms, we empower businesses to leverage technology in ways that improve customer engagement and operational efficiency.

## Our Current Offering

Our flagship product is a customizable loyalty and rewards platform, internally known as **"Novara: Rewards"**, which can be fully rebranded for our clients. The platform consists of a web portal, a feature-complete iOS app, and an MVP version of our Android app. 

### Key Features:
- **Customer, Employee, and Owner Accounts**: Tailored functionality for each role.
- **Reward Management**: Customers earn rewards by scanning QR codes, which can be redeemed by admins or owners.
- **Advanced Reward Options**: Higher-tier accounts unlock features such as timed rewards, scheduled rewards, and single-redemption rewards.
- **Analytics & Notifications**: Owners and employees can access location information, manage push notifications, and perform CRUD operations on rewards.
- **Cross-platform Access**: The system is manageable via both the web portal and mobile apps (iOS, with Android coming soon).
